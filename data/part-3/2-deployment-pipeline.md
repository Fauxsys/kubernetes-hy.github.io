After this section you can

- Create your own deployment pipeline to GKE with Github Actions and enable continuous delivery from a git push to production

</text-box>


Let's setup a deployment pipeline using GitHub actions. We just need something to deploy so let's create a new website.

Create a Dockerfile with the following contents:

```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:1.19-alpine

COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
```

and add index.html with the following content

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body style="background-color: gray;">
    <p>
      Content
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's make sure that everything works by doing `docker image build . -t colorcontent && docker run -p 3000:80 colorcontent` to build and run it and then accessing it through [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Next is the addition of manifests for our website.

**manifests/service.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dwk-environments-svc
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: dwk-environments
  ports:
    - port: 80
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 80
```

**manifests/deployment.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dwk-environments
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dwk-environments
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dwk-environments
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: dwk-environments
          image: jakousa/colorcontent
```

Next, to test our manifests deploy this into our cluster. Above I had pushed the built image using `docker image push`.

```console
$ kubectl apply -f manifests/service.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f manifests/deployment.yaml
```

### Kustomize ###

Applying multiple files like this gets bothersome. We can of course point it at a directory like so: `kubectl apply -f manifests/`, but this is an excellent moment to turn our attention to Kustomize.

[Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) is a tool that helps with configuration customization and is baked into kubectl. In this case we'll use it to define which files are meaningful for Kubernetes.

For us a new file *kustomization.yaml* in the root of the project will work. The *kustomization.yaml* should include instructions to use the deployment.yaml and service.yaml.

**kustomization.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- manifests/deployment.yaml
- manifests/service.yaml
```

Now we can deploy this using the `-k` flag identifying that we want to use Kustomize.

```console
$ kubectl apply -k .
```

We can preview the file with `kubectl kustomize .`. Kustomize will be an essential tool for our deployment pipeline. It'll allow us to individually choose which image to use. For this let's declare the image inside the kustomization.yaml.

**kustomization.yaml**

```yaml
...
images:
- name: PROJECT/IMAGE
  newName: jakousa/colorcontent
```

This will replace the image "IMAGE:TAG" with the one defined in _newName_. Next setting a placeholder value inside the deployment.yaml for the image:

**deployment.yaml**

```yaml
      ...
      containers:
        - name: dwk-environments
          image: PROJECT/IMAGE
```

Test that everything works

```console
$ kubectl kustomize .
  ...
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: jakousa/colorcontent
        name: dwk-environments
```

Kustomize has a few additional tools you can test out if you want to install it - but we'll see the usage in the next section.

### Github Actions ###

Github Actions will be the CI/CD tool of choice for this course. The behavior is similar to CircleCI or even Travis which you may have used previously. Google also offers [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build), and a [step-by-step guide to deploying to GKE](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/deploying-builds/deploy-gke) with it. You can return here to implement deployment with Cloud Build if you have credits left over after the course!

Create a file .github/workflows/main.yaml. We'll want the workflow to do 3 things:

* build the image
* publish the image to a container registry
* deploy the new image to our cluster

The initial config will look something like this:

**main.yaml**

```yaml
name: Release application

on:
  push:

env:
  GKE_CLUSTER: dwk-cluster
  GKE_ZONE: europe-north1-b
  IMAGE: dwk-environments
```

We set the workflow to run whenever changes are pushed to the repository and set the environment variables accordingly - we'll need them later on.

Next is adding the jobs. For simplicity we'll add everything into a single job that'll build, publish and deploy.

```yaml
...
jobs:
  build-publish-deploy:
    name: Build, Publish and Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

This sets the environment for the job and triggers the [checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout) as the first step.

Next we'll use some additional actions, mainly from [GoogleCloudPlatform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions) that are designed to help on deployments to Google Cloud.

```yaml
...
    - uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/setup-gcloud@master
      with:
        service_account_key: ${{ secrets.GKE_SA_KEY }}
        project_id: ${{ secrets.GKE_PROJECT }}
```

The secrets here are not from the environment variables but are included into the project from Github. Read their guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets). The *GKE\_SA\_KEY* is a service account key that is required to access the google cloud services - read their guide for it [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).

Next use _gcloud_ commands to configure Docker and this will enable us to push to Google Container Registry, which we'll use instead of Docker Hub. We could use Docker Hub if we wanted to do so but GCR is an excellent option now that we have access to it. GCR is a lot more performant and has a low network latency. Cutting down on the time we spend moving images around will ensure our deployments are quick. Read more about it here <https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/>. Note that the registry is [not free](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/pricing) and you'll probably want to delete the images from there during and after this course.

```yaml
...
    - run: gcloud --quiet auth configure-docker
```

And then we'll set the kubectl access to the right cluster, as defined in the environment variables.

```yaml
...
    - run: gcloud container clusters get-credentials "$GKE_CLUSTER" --zone "$GKE_ZONE"
```

And finally let's write out the desired image with a tag. The image in this case will be `gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/IMAGE:GITHUB_BRANCH-GITHUB_SHA` and stored to the environment value IMAGE_WITH_TAG.

```yaml
...
    - name: Create image name and tag
      run: echo "::set-env name=IMAGE_WITH_TAG::gcr.io/${{ secrets.GKE_PROJECT }}/$IMAGE:${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}-$GITHUB_SHA"
```

Now the setup is done and next is building the image:

```yaml
...
    - name: Build
      run: docker image build --tag "$IMAGE_WITH_TAG" .
```

Publish similarily:

```yaml
...
    - name: Publish
      run: docker image push "$IMAGE_WITH_TAG"
```

And finally deployment. We'll setup Kustomize first:

```yaml
...
    - name: Set up Kustomize
      run: |-
        curl -sfLo kustomize https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/download/v3.1.0/kustomize_3.1.0_linux_amd64
        chmod u+x ./kustomize
```

And with Kustomize we can set the image PROJECT/IMAGE as the one we just published and apply it. Finally we'll preview the *rollout* and confirm that the release was a success.

```yaml
...
    - name: Deploy
      run: |-
        ./kustomize edit set image PROJECT/IMAGE=$IMAGE_WITH_TAG
        kubectl apply -k .
        kubectl rollout status deployment $IMAGE
```

<exercise name='Exercise 3.03: Project v1.4'>

  Setup automatic deployment for the project as well.

</exercise>

### Separate environment for each branch ###

A quite popular choice when using a deployment pipeline is having a separate environment for every branch - especially when using feature branching.

Let's implement our own version of this. Let's extend the previously defined pipeline. Previously this was our final state:

**main.yaml**

```yaml
name: Release application

on:
  push:

env:
  GKE_CLUSTER: dwk-cluster
  GKE_ZONE: europe-north1-b
  IMAGE: dwk-environments

jobs:
  setup-build-publish-deploy:
    name: Setup, Build, Publish, and Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Create image name and tag
      run: echo "::set-env name=IMAGE_WITH_TAG::gcr.io/${{ secrets.GKE_PROJECT }}/$IMAGE:${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}-$GITHUB_SHA"

    - uses: GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/setup-gcloud@master
      with:
        service_account_key: ${{ secrets.GKE_SA_KEY }}
        project_id: ${{ secrets.GKE_PROJECT }}

    - run: gcloud --quiet auth configure-docker

    - run: gcloud container clusters get-credentials "$GKE_CLUSTER" --zone "$GKE_ZONE"

    - name: Build
      run: docker image build --tag "$IMAGE_WITH_TAG" .

    - name: Publish
      run: docker image push "$IMAGE_WITH_TAG"

    - name: Set up Kustomize
      run: |-
        curl -sfLo kustomize https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/download/v3.1.0/kustomize_3.1.0_linux_amd64
        chmod u+x ./kustomize

    - name: Deploy
      run: |-
        ./kustomize edit set image PROJECT/IMAGE=$IMAGE_WITH_TAG
        kubectl apply -k .
        kubectl rollout status deployment $IMAGE
```

What we'll want to do is deploy each branch into a separate namespace so that each branch has its own separate environment.
Kustomize has a method to set the namespace. *${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}* will be the branch name.

```console
./kustomize edit set namespace ${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}
```

But this will error as there's no namespace defined. So we need to add a creation of a namespace

```console
kubectl create namespace ${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/} || true
```

But since now we're namespaced the rollout status will fail. So let's set the namespace to be used

```console
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}
```

So in the correct order and inside the Deploy:

```yaml
    - name: Deploy
      run: |-
        kubectl create namespace ${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/} || true
        kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}
        ./kustomize edit set namespace ${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}
        ./kustomize edit set image PROJECT/IMAGE=$IMAGE_WITH_TAG
        kubectl apply -k .
        kubectl rollout status deployment $IMAGE
```

To test this, edit the index.html and publish the changes to a new branch.

The next step would be to configure the domain names for each branch so that we'd have "www.example.com" as the production and e.g. "feat_x.example.com" as the feat_x branch. If you have any credits left after the course you can return here and implement it. Google Cloud DNS and this [guide](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/configuring-domain-name-static-ip) can get you started.
